IML++ (Iterative Methods Library) v. 1.2a

IML++ is a C++ templated library of modern iterative methods for solving both symmetric and nonsymmetric linear systems of equations. The algorithms are fully templated in that the same source code works for dense, sparse, and distributed matrices. Some of the numerical methods are presented in the book, Templates: Building Blocks for the Solution of Iterative Systems and include
